Branch Textfiles

The version 1.0 the lyrics and associated tabs for each song are found in the song.js file as a object componet. This works but is an unelegant solution. It would be much better and more managable system if I could store each song as a txt file and read the lyrics from it. The only lead I have is I think I need to add a configuration to the webpack config making it so it imports txt files with raw-loader or asset/source.
